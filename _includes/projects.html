            <p>WatchfulSky is an Android application written in Java that allows users to track satellites in real time and view the current arrangement of the planets. Satellite information is collected in the form of NORAD two-line element data from <a href="https://celestrak.com/">Celestrak</a>. Orbital calculation are then completed using <a href="https://www.orekit.org/">Orekit</a>.</p>

            <p>From the main screen the user can navigate to the satellite tracking or planet tracking functionality. </p>
            <p>When the satellite tracking option is selected a list of satellites will appear allowing the user to pick any of the NORAD registered satellites for tracking. Once a satellite is selected its current position is plotted on google maps along with its former and future paths. From the maps screen the user can view information about the satellite, add the satellite to the favorites list, or use the time picker. The time picker allows the user to see where a satellite will be at a user designated time by adding a new marker.</p>
            <p>When the plant alignment option is selected a movable view of the solar system is displayed allowing the user to explore the current layout of the planets and read information about each planets movement.</p>
