            <p>Due to the vastness of Canada’s wilderness, it is infeasible to provide cellular service throughout the entire country. However it is often in these places that cellular service and the need for reliable communication is highest. As a solution to this problem, the Chirp Nets device is being created. This device is a mesh networking device that will allow users with the device to communicate with each other in areas without cellular service.</p>
            <p>The Chirp Nets device will include several subsystems that must work together for it to be successful. These subsystems include the physical hardware, the firmware that manages the interactions and communications, the routing algorithm that manages how the messages are sent and the mobile application that the user interacts with to communicate through the device. To be a successful project the device must be able to communicate over a mesh network of at least three nodes and containing one ‘hop’ meaning the message is not sent directly to the destination but is passed by a middle device. </p>
            <p>My role with Chirp Nets is the design and assembly of the hardware and the low level radio management code within the firmware. The firmware code is open source and available at the <a href=https://github.com/chirpnets/chirp-nets-firmware>github repo</a></p>
            <p> The following key components were used: <br />
                1x Microcontroller + Bluetooth Transceiver + Power Controller<br />
                (Adafruit Feather NRF52 BlueFruit)<br />
                1x RF Transceiver (Adafruit FeatherWing RFM69HCW 900Mhz)<br />
                1x Battery (Lithium Ion Polymer 3.7v 400mAh)<br />
                1x Antenna (915Mhz Simple String Antenna)<br /></p>

            <p>WatchfulSky is an Android application written in Java that allows users to track satellites in real time and view the current arrangement of the planets. Satellite information is collected in the form of NORAD two-line element data from <a href="https://celestrak.com/">Celestrak</a>. Orbital calculation are then completed using <a href="https://www.orekit.org/">Orekit</a>.</p>

            <p>From the main screen the user can navigate to the satellite tracking or planet tracking functionality. </p>
            <p>When the satellite tracking option is selected a list of satellites will appear allowing the user to pick any of the NORAD registered satellites for tracking. Once a satellite is selected its current position is plotted on google maps along with its former and future paths. From the maps screen the user can view information about the satellite, add the satellite to the favorites list, or use the time picker. The time picker allows the user to see where a satellite will be at a user designated time by adding a new marker.</p>
            <p>When the plant alignment option is selected a movable view of the solar system is displayed allowing the user to explore the current layout of the planets and read information about each planets movement.</p>
